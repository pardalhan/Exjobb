\section{Time plan}

This section describes how the time will be distributed between different tasks and parts during the thesis work. The time given for this thesis work is 800 hours and a working day (d) is usually 8 hours. This means that the  time resources is 100 work days for this thesis work. The time is distributed between the different task in \cref{table:time_consumption}.

	landmarks based on the Deformable Part Models. We treat the task
	of landmark detection as an instance of the structured output
	classification problem. We propose to learn the parameters of the
	detector from data by the Structured Output Support Vector
	Machines algorithm. In contrast to the previous works, the
	objective function of the learning algorithm is directly related
	to the performance of the resulting detector which is controlled
	by a user-defined loss function. The resulting detector is
	real-time on a standard PC, simple to implement and it can be
	easily modified for detection of a different set of landmarks.  We
	evaluate performance of the proposed landmark detector on a
	challenging ''Labeled Faces in the Wild`` (LFW) database. The
	empirical results demonstrate that the proposed detector is
	consistently more accurate than two public domain implementations
	based on the Active Appearance Models and the Deformable Part
	Models. We provide an open-source implementation of the proposed
	detector and the manual annotation of the facial landmarks for all
	images in the LFW database.},
